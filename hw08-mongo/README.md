Use MongoDB and Spring Data for storing book information

## Goal

After completing this homework, you will be able to use Spring Data MongoDB and MongoDB itself to develop applications that store data in a non-relational database.

## Result

Application using MongoDB

## Description

- Use Spring Data MongoDB repositories, and if functionality is lacking, use *Operations
- Tests can be implemented using Flapdoodle Embedded MongoDB
- Hibernate, JPA, and spring-boot-starter-data-jpa should not remain as dependencies if this homework is based on the previous one
- How to store books, authors, genres, and comments is up to you. However, structures carried over from relational databases are not always suitable for MongoDB.

Use WebFlux

## Goal

Develop responsive and resilient applications using the reactive Spring stack with Spring WebFlux and Reactive Spring Data Repositories

## Result

An application built on the reactive Spring stack

## Description

- You can base your work on the homework that uses Ajax + REST (a traditional web application is not the best choice for this).
- However, you can choose a different domain model (not necessarily a library).
- You must use Reactive Spring Data Repositories.
- It’s better to use MongoDB or Redis as the database. Using PostgreSQL and the experimental R2DBC is not recommended.
- RxJava vs Project Reactor — choose whichever you prefer.
- Instead of the classical Spring MVC and embedded web server, use WebFlux.
- Optional: implement using Functional Endpoints.
- Try to eliminate unnecessary architectural layers. The simplest option is to keep the entire flow in the controller.

# Application Architecture

The application is implemented using a microservices architecture, applying modern cloud-native development standards, and thus offers strong _scalability_, _fault tolerance_, and _observability_.

- The application guarantees message delivery using the Outbox pattern implemented via CDC with MongoDB Change Streams.
- The application uses an idempotent approach for handling POST requests and Kafka consumer messages.
- The application implements fault tolerance mechanisms:
  - Circuit Breaker (for HTTP status 503 Service Unavailable)
  - IP-based Rate Limiter (Token Bucket)
  - Time Limiter (Timeout)
  - Retry (for transient HTTP statuses)

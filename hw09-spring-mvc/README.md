CRUD application with Web UI and database storage

## Goal

Develop full-featured classic Web applications

## Result

A full Web application using the Spring stack

## Description

- Create an application with entity storage in a database (you may reuse a library and DAO/repositories from previous assignments)
- Use classic Views with Thymeleaf and traditional Controllers
- For books (the main entity), all CRUD operations should be available via the UI. CRUD for other entities is optional/as needed
- Test the controller(s) for CRUD operations on books using @WebMvcTest and mocked services
- Localization is NOT required â€” it is strictly optional
